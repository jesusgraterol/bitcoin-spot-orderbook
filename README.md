# Bitcoin Spot Order Book

When coding automated trading systems, it is essential to have a deep understanding  of how trades are filled and how the price is affected by the existing liquidity (Bids & Asks).

This notebook will download the current order book state from a Bitcoin Exchange, process the data, identify the liquidity peaks based on their intensity and based on the results of the analysis, determine which side (bids or asks) is dominating the market.
